\chapter*{Abstract}

\input{abstract.tex}

% Proof assistants are software systems that allow for the precise checking of
% mathematical reasoning. They can be general purpose (like Coq, Lean,
% Isabelle...) or more specialized like EasyCrypt. They enable a level of accuracy
% which certifies that no error can occur, have given birth to a wide range of
% practical and theoretical works, and have been used in a wide range of
% applications. But they remain difficult to use.

% We propose a new paradigm of formal proof construction through actions performed
% in a graphical user interface, to enable a more comfortable and intuitive use.
% Our paradigm builds upon direct manipulation principles, combining both old
% (Proof-by-Pointing) and new (Proof-by-Linking) interaction techniques that
% exploit recent advances in deep inference proof theory. We implement this
% paradigm in a prototype of graphical user interface called Actema, using modern
% web-based technologies. We also design a generic protocol for plugging Actema on
% any proof system that supports first-order intuitionistic logic. This protocol
% is deployed inside the Coq proof assistant through the coq-actema plugin,
% offering users the ability to integrate graphical proofs into existing textual
% developments.

% % Then, driven by the will to integrate and improve the various interaction
% % techniques of Actema in a unified formalism, we explore a series of deep
% % inference proof calculi that give more structure to the notion of logical goal.
% % These calculi share the ability to be represented in two alternative ways:
% % either textually through a standard inductive syntax, or graphically through a
% % metaphorical notation well-suited to direct manipulation. In particular, we
% % propose to recast C.S. Peirce's theory of existential graphs as a system for
% % interactive, goal-oriented proof building. We support this claim with another
% % web-based prototype of graphical user interface, the Flower Prover, which has
% % the property of working well on touch-based devices of varying screen sizes.

% Then, driven by the will to improve the various interaction techniques of Actema
% in a unified formalism, we explore a series of deep inference proof systems that
% give more structure to the notion of logical goal. These systems share the
% ability to represent goals in two alternative ways: either textually through a
% standard inductive syntax, or graphically through a metaphorical notation
% well-suited to direct manipulation.

% The first family of systems, called bubble calculi, is an extension of the
% theory of nested sequents, that we reframe as local rewriting systems with a
% graphical and topological interpretation. Bubble calculi enable an efficient
% sharing of contexts between subgoals, making them well-suited to the
% factorization of both forward and backward reasoning steps in proofs. The second
% system, called flower calculus, is an intuitionistic refinement of C.S. Peirce's
% theory of existential graphs, understood as a system for interactive,
% goal-directed proof building. It provides more iconic and economical means of
% reasoning than bubble calculi, by exposing fewer inference rules that all work
% directly on the goals themselves, removing the need for logical connectives.
% % This should make the system easier to learn for users unfamiliar with symbolic
% % logic, by bridging the gap between statements and their proofs.
% Both types of systems are shown to be analytic and fully invertible, making them
% amenable to proof automation techniques.

% We finally go back to practical experimentation by designing and implementing
% the Flower Prover, another web-based prototype of GUI for interactive proof
% building based on the flower calculus. An innovative feature of the Flower
% Prover is that it works well on modern mobile devices, thanks to its responsive
% layout and first-class support for touch interactions.

% % The first family of systems, dubbed Bubble Calculi, is an extension of the
% % theory of nested sequents, that we reframe as local rewriting systems with a
% % graphical and topological interpretation. They enable a more efficient sharing
% % of contexts between subgoals, represented as so-called bubbles. Combined with
% % their perfect symmetry, this makes them well-suited to the factorization of both
% % forward and backward reasoning steps in proofs. We also show how they are able
% % to capture intuitionistic, dual-intuitionistic, bi-intuitionistic and classical
% % logic as fragments of a single calculus, that correspond to various physical
% % laws governing the porosity of bubbles.

% % The second system, dubbed Flower Calculus, is an intuitionistic refinement of
% % C.S. Peirce's theory of existential graphs, understood as a system for
% % interactive, goal-oriented proof building. It provides more iconic and
% % economical means of reasoning than Bubble Calculi, by requiring fewer inference
% % rules that all work directly on the goals themselves, removing the need for
% % logical connectives. To our knowledge, we provide the first proof of analyticity
% % of existential graphs in the literature, through a normalization-by-evaluation
% % argument with respect to Kripke models. Altogether, this should make the system
% % amenable both to new proof automation techniques, and interaction with users
% % unfamiliar with symbolic logic, bridging the gap between statements and their
% % proofs.
