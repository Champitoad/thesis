Proof assistants are advanced tools used in mathematics and computer science to ensure the accuracy of reasoning. However, they are quite difficult to use, making them reserved to a highly trained audience.

We propose a new way of building proofs with a user-friendly graphical interface called Actema. Actema simplifies the process by letting users interact directly with mathematical statements through click and drag-and-drop actions, avoiding the use of a complex programming language. We have integrated Actema with Coq, a popular proof assistant, so users can seamlessly incorporate graphical proofs into their work.

To improve Actema's usability, we explore new ways of representing mathematical statements. These representations, known as bubble calculi and flower calculus, offer efficient ways to manage and build proofs interactively. Bubble calculi focus on sharing information between different parts of a proof, while the flower calculus simplifies reasoning by using intuitive diagrams that look like flowers. Both approaches ensure that reasoning is logical and accurate.

We have also developed the Flower Prover, a prototype of graphical user interface based on the flower calculus. It is designed to work well on modern mobile devices, making it accessible to a wider audience. Our goal is to make proof construction more intuitive and accessible for everyone.
