- Introduce a special format for long digressions in sidenotes, so that the
  reader can safely ignore them.
- Change colors of various kaoboxes, as in Komel's thesis (theorems, lemmas,
  definitions, remarks...)
- Small, non-bold text for subheadings in chapter TOCs, as in Lennon-Bertrand's
  thesis
- Directly link rule name occurrences to the rule definition.
