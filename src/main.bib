  abstract  = {Lean 4 is a reimplementation of the Lean interactive theorem prover (ITP) in Lean itself. It addresses many shortcomings of the previous versions and contains many new features. Lean 4 is fully extensible: users can modify and extend the parser, elaborator, tactics, decision procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on tabled resolution, addressing significant performance problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also an efficient functional programming language based on a novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place. Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because many write custom proof automation procedures in Lean itself.},

  abstract = { A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the method is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics - which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed - are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited. }

These linguistic approaches have a drawback: the languages are not generally portable, even though the nature of logical reasoning is universal. We propose a somewhat speculative alternative method that lets the user directly manipulate the text of the theorem, using non-linguistic metaphors. It uses a proof formalism based on linking subformulas, which is a variant of deep inference (inference rules are allowed to apply in any formula context) where the relevant formulas in a rule are allowed to be arbitrarily distant. We substantiate the design with a prototype implementation of a linking-based interactive prover for ﬁrst-order classical linear logic.},

The most popular proof assistants today all have user interfaces that are largely text-based. This leads to a steep learning curve for new users of these tools. In this paper, we propose a framework for designing user interfaces for proof assistants based on pointing and clicking. While a main goal of the design is ease of learning for new users, we intend for the design to be suitable for real verification tasks. The design is also extensible, allowing custom proof methods and search functionality to be added in a convenient way. We implement our ideas in a web interface, with backend provided by holpy, a new system for interactive theorem proving implemented in Python. The resulting user interface is tested on theorems in logic, sets, functions, Peano arithmetic, and lists, demonstrating its applicability in a wide range of areas.},

  abstract = {We present the “ProofWidgets” framework for implementing general user interfaces (UIs) within an interactive theorem prover. The framework uses web technology and functional reactive programming, as well as metaprogramming features of advanced interactive theorem proving (ITP) systems to allow users to create arbitrary interactive UIs for representing the goal state. Users of the framework can create GUIs declaratively within the ITP’s metaprogramming language, without having to develop in multiple languages and without coordinated changes across multiple projects, which improves development time for new designs of UI. The ProofWidgets framework also allows UIs to make use of the full context of the theorem prover and the specialised libraries that ITPs offer, such as methods for dealing with expressions and tactics. The framework includes an extensible structured pretty-printing engine that enables advanced interaction with expressions such as interactive term rewriting. We exemplify the framework with an implementation for the leanprover-community fork of Lean 3. The framework is already in use by hundreds of contributors to the Lean mathematical library.},

In this book Sun-Joo Shin explores the philosophical roots of the birth of Peirce's Existential Graphs in his theory of representation and logical notation. Shin demonstrates that Peirce is the first philosopher to lay a solid philosophical foundation for multimodal representation systems.Shin analyzes Peirce's well-known, but much-criticized nonsymbolic representation system. She presents a new approach to his graphical system based on her discovery of its unique nature and on a reconstruction of Peirce's theory of representation. By seeking to understand graphical systems on their own terms, she uncovers the reasons why graphical systems, and Existential Graphs in particular, have been underappreciated among logicians. Drawing on perspectives from the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, logic, and computer science, Shin provides evidence for a genuinely interdisciplinary project on multimodal reasoning.}},

Besides revealing dualities which are not immediately apparent in the traditional presentation of the presheaf hyperdoctrine, this reconstruction leads us to an axiomatic treatment of directed equality predicates (modelled by hom presheaves), realizing a vision initially set out by Lawvere (1970). It also leads to a simple calculus of string diagrams (representing presheaves) that is highly reminiscent of C. S. Peirce's existential graphs for predicate logic, refining an earlier interpretation of existential graphs in terms of Boolean hyperdoctrines by Brady and Trimble. Finally, we illustrate how this work extends to a bifibrational setting a number of fundamental ideas of linear logic.},

  abstract   = {In interactive theorem provers (ITPs), extensible syntax is not only crucial to lower the cognitive burden of manipulating complex mathematical objects, but plays a critical role in developing reusable abstractions in libraries. Most ITPs support such extensions in the form of restrictive "syntax sugar" substitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support many desirable abstractions. As a result, libraries are littered with unnecessary redundancy. Tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a seemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. We take ideas from the Scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. We further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. We have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the new version of the Lean theorem prover, Lean 4. Despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.},

I will also brieﬂy discuss the places where proof assistants are used and how we envision their extended use in the future. While being an introduction into the world of proof assistants and the main issues behind them, this paper is also a position paper that pushes the further use of proof assistants. We believe that these systems will become the future of mathematics, where deﬁnitions, statements, computations and proofs are all available in a computerized form. An important application is and will be in computer supported modelling and veriﬁcation of systems. But there is still a long road ahead and I will indicate what we believe is needed for the further proliferation of proof assistants.},

  abstract  = {Text editing is powerful, but some types of expressions are more naturally represented and manipulated graphically. Examples include expressions that compute colors, music, animations, tabular data, plots, diagrams, and other domain-specific data structures. This paper introduces live literals, or livelits, which allow clients to fill holes of types like these by directly manipulating a user-defined GUI embedded persistently into code. Uniquely, livelits are compositional: a livelit GUI can itself embed spliced expressions, which are typed, lexically scoped, and can in turn embed other livelits. Livelits are also uniquely live: a livelit can provide continuous feedback about the run-time implications of the client’s choices even when splices mention bound variables, because the system continuously gathers closures associated with the hole that the livelit is filling. We integrate livelits into Hazel, a live hole-driven programming environment, and describe case studies that exercise these novel capabilities. We then define a simply typed livelit calculus, which specifies how livelits operate as live graphical macros. The metatheory of macro expansion has been mechanized in Agda.},

These linguistic approaches have a drawback: the languages are not generally portable, even though the nature of logical reasoning is universal. We propose a somewhat speculative alternative method that lets the user directly manipulate the text of the theorem, using non-linguistic metaphors. It uses a proof formalism based on linking subformulas, which is a variant of deep inference (inference rules are allowed to apply in any formula context) where the relevant formulas in a rule are allowed to be arbitrarily distant. We substantiate the design with a prototype implementation of a linking-based interactive prover for ﬁrst-order classical linear logic.},

I propose here one such model, in the area of Logic Programming, where the basic computational principle is Computation = Proof search. Proofs considered here are those of the Gentzen style sequent calculus for Linear Logic. However, proofs in this system may be redundant, in that two proofs can be syntactically di erent although identical up to some irrelevant reordering or simpli cation of the applications of the inference rules. This leads to an untractable proof search where the search procedure is forced to make costly choices which turn out to be irrelevant. To overcome this problem, a subclass of proofs, called the {\textbackslash}focusing" proofs, which is both complete (any derivable formula in Linear Logic has a focusing proof) and tractable (many irrelevant choices in the search are eliminated when aimed at focusing proofs) is identi ed. The main constraint underlying the speci cation of focusing proofs has been to preserve the symmetry of Linear Logic, which is its most salient feature. In particular, dual connectives have dual properties with respect to focusing proofs.},

Within linear logic, the focused proof system of Andreoli provides an elegant and comprehensive normal form for cut-free proofs. Within intuitionistic and classical logics, there are various diﬀerent proof systems in the literature that exhibit focusing behavior. These focused proof systems have been applied to both the proof search and the proof normalization approaches to computation. We present a new, focused proof system for intuitionistic logic, called {LJF}, and show how other intuitionistic proof systems can be mapped into the new system by inserting logical connectives that prematurely stop focusing. We also use {LJF} to design a focused proof system {LKF} for classical logic. Our approach to the design and analysis of these systems is based on the completeness of focusing in linear logic and on the notion of polarity that appears in Girard’s {LC} and {LU} proof systems.},

  abstract = { A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the method is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics - which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed - are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited. }

  abstract = {Traditionally, mathematical logic has been content with ‘in principle’ formalizations of deductive inference, which place little emphasis on the description of practical reasoning. Requirements for formal descriptions of practical inference methods are now emerging however. For example, interactive reasoning systems are needed for verification of computer systems, and should support practically convenient reasoning techniques as strongly as possible. This paper describes a proof paradigm which formalises a hierarchical, problem-reduction style of reasoning which is widely useful in practical reasoning. It is a goal directed paradigm, which gives a central role to equivalence transformations. A hierarchy of subgoals can co-exist at a single point in the proof, and these subgoals may be of arbitrary type. The approach allows good access to contextual information when transforming subgoals, and can be applied to a variety of logics.},

  title    = {Design of point-and-click user interfaces for proof assistants},
  abstract = {In interactive theorem proving, human users interact with proof assistants to construct and verify formal proofs. The most popular proof assistants today all have user interfaces that are largely text-based. This leads to a steep learning curve for new users of these tools. In this paper, we propose a framework for designing user interfaces for proof assistants based on pointing and clicking. While a main goal of the design is ease of learning for new users, we intend for the design to be suitable for real verification tasks. The design is also extensible, allowing custom proof methods and search functionality to be added in a convenient way. We implement our ideas in a web interface, with backend provided by holpy, a new system for interactive theorem proving implemented in Python. The resulting user interface is tested on theorems in logic, sets, functions, Peano arithmetic, and lists, demonstrating its applicability in a wide range of areas.},

Our transformation system TAS compiles these rules to concrete deduction support, complete with a graphical user interface with command-language-free user interaction by gestures like drag\&drop and proof-by-pointing, and a development management for transformational proofs. It is generic in the sense that it is completely independent of the particular window inference or transformational calculus, and can be instantiated to many diﬀerent ones; three such instantiations are presented in the paper.},

  abstract  = {We present a user-friendly approach to unifying program creation and execution, based on a notion of "tangible values" (TVs), which are visual and interactive manifestations of pure values, including functions. Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative style.In realizing this vision, we develop algebras for visual presentation and for "deep" function application, where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples, functions, etc. Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations.},
