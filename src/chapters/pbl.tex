\chapter{Subformula Linking}
\labch{pbl}

% In the previous chapter, we showed how to associate a logical behaviour to
% drag-and-drop actions involving two subterms in a sequent, by following a set of
% rewrite rules on formulas. While we proved the soundness of these rules and a
% so-called \emph{productivity} property that makes them suitable for interactive
% proof exploration, we left untreated a central question when doing proof theory:
% \emph{completeness}. That is, can we prove any true statement using only these
% rewrite rules? The answer is \emph{yes}, and \refsec{sfl-completeness} gives
