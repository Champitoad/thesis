\epigraph{In a certain flower garden, each flower was either red, yellow, or
blue, and all three colors were represented. A statistician once visited the
garden and made the observation that whatever three flowers you picked, at least
one of them was bound to be red. A second statistician visited the garden and
made the observation that whatever three flowers you picked, at least one was
bound to be yellow. Two logic students heard about this and got into an ar-
gument. The first student said: "It therefore follows that whatever three
flowers you pick, at least one is bound to be blue, doesn't it?" The second
student said: "Of course not!". Which student was right, and why?
}{\textbf{Raymond Smullyan}, \textit{The Flower Garden}, 1985}

We introduce the \emph{flower calculus}, a novel proof system for intuitionistic
predicate logic based on syntactic objects called \emph{flowers}. We start by
explaining how flowers stem from considerations in graphical logic, and more
specifically from a constructivization of the \emph{existential graphs}
(thereafter ``EGs'') of C. S. Peirce proposed by A. Oostra
\sidecite[12.5em]{oostra_graficos_2010}. Then we present our inductive syntax
for flowers, reminiscent at the same time of the nested sequents of deep
inference proof theory, and the geometric formulas of categorical logic. A
salient feature of our calculus inherited from EGs, is that it is \emph{fully
iconic}: it dispenses completely with the traditional notion of symbolic
formula, operating instead as a rewriting system on flowers containing only
atomic predicates. We also propose a notion of proof geared towards analyticity
results Ã  la Gentzen, suggesting new rules absent from other works on
existential graphs. This allows us to prove admissibility theorems for many
structural rules, including Peirce's erasure rule which is a variant of
Gentzen's cut rule. These results are obtained as a consequence of our soundness
and completeness proofs with respect to Kripke semantics, in the spirit of the
\emph{normalization-by-evaluation} technique \sidecite{NbE}. Furthermore, the
kernel of rules targetted by completeness is fully invertible, a desirable
property in both automated and interactive proof search.

The chapter is organized as follows: in \refsec{EGs}, we give a brief
presentation of the original diagrammatic system \sys{Alpha} of EGs for
classical propositional logic, together with a reformulation as a rewriting
system on arbitrary (finite) trees. In \refsec{Flowers}, we explain how to
obtain the intuitionistic variant of EGs put forth by A. Oostra
\cite{oostra_graficos_2010} through a subtle topological distinction added to
the graphical representation, which reflects in the inductive syntax. In
\refsec{Quantification}, we illustrate quickly the original mechanism of
\emph{lines of identity} used by Peirce to handle quantifiers and equality in
his \sys{Beta} system, and show how to recast it in a more traditional syntax
based on binders and variables. In \refsec{Calculus}, we introduce the full set
of inference rules of the flower calculus as well as our notion of proof, and
prove a few syntactic properties, including a deduction theorem. In
\refsec{Semantics}, we give a direct Kripke semantics to flowers, avoiding the
need for translations to and from traditional formulas. In \refsec{Soundness},
we show that the rules of the flower calculus are valid with respect to our
Kripke semantics, and in \refsec{Completeness} we identify a complete fragment
of the system where all rules are \emph{invertible}. This entails the
admissibility of the rest of the rules, and as a consequence the
\emph{analyticity} of the system. We exploit these properties in
\refsec{flowers-search} by describing an algorithm for fully automated proof
search in the propositional fragment, that we conjecture to be complete. Then in
\refsec{flowers-prover} we give an overview of the Flower Prover, a prototype of
GUI in the Proof-by-Action paradigm whose actions map directly to the rules of
the flower calculus, and which integrates nicely with our search procedure. In
\refsec{flowers-curryhoward}, we briefly sketch some ideas for a Curry-Howard
correspondence, where flowers and actions for manipulating them are identified
respectively with \emph{normal} and \emph{neutral} terms of the
$\lambda$-calculus. We conclude in \refsec{Conclusion} by a comparison with some
related works, and a discussion of future works and applications that we
envision.

\todo{IDEA (where should we put it?): \emph{superposition of polarities} in
existential graphs. While a cut in bubble calculi is the insertion of \emph{two}
occurrences of the same formula with \emph{distinct} polarities, the insertion
rule only introduces \emph{one} occurrence of the formula, which plays either a
negative role when it is iterated, or a positive role when it is deiterated}

% \section{Introduction}

% \subsection{Interactive proof building}

% Given a sufficiently expressive logic, the problem of finding a formal proof of
% a given statement in that logic is notoriously hard. Not only because of
% undecidability, but because proof calculi are very rigid, and expose too many
% details compared to the informal proofs that mathematicians are used to write.

% One way to tackle this limitation is to design search procedures for interesting
% fragments of the logic under consideration. This is the approach undertaken by
% automated theorem provers such as SMT solvers, or more specialized decision
% procedures such as Coq's \texttt{lia} tactic for linear integer arithmetic.
% Still, large-scale proofs of complex theorems currently require a human in the
% loop to provide the overall structure of arguments, but also of the theories
% built up from definitions and lemmas.

% This is where proof assistants come in, by providing a set of tools to make the
% whole process of formalizing mathematical developments easier. This includes
% languages to specify definitions and statements conveniently, but also
% interfaces to build proofs interactively without having to fill in all the
% details. The dominant paradigm for these interfaces is that of \emph{tactic
% languages} \sidecite{doi:10.1098/rsta.1984.0067}: the user is exposed with a set of
% \emph{goals} that remain to be proved, also called the \emph{proof state}, and
% modifies these goals through textual commands called \emph{tactics} until there
% is no goal left. This is currently what is implemented in mainstream proof
% assistants such as Coq \sidecite{the_coq_development_team_2022_7313584}, Isabelle
% \sidecite{nipkow2002isabelle} and Lean \sidecite{10.1007/978-3-030-79876-5_37}.

% \subsection{Graphical interfaces}

% In recent years, there have been many efforts to replace or complement textual
% tactic languages with modern \emph{graphical user interfaces} \sidecite{PbP}
% \sidecite{langbacka-tkwinhol-1995} \sidecite{Chaudhuri2013} \sidecite{edukera}
% \sidecite{zhan-design-2019} \sidecite{ayers_graphical_2021}. The hope is to make proof
% assistants more intuitive and accessible to beginners and non-specialists, but
% also to some extent more productive and ergonomic for experts. 

% The initial motivation for this work was to design a proof calculus well-suited
% to \emph{direct manipulation} in such a graphical setting. The idea is that the
% user should be able to interact directly with the graphical representation of
% the proof state, using a pointing device such as a mouse or fingers on a touch
% screen. In previous work \sidecite{10.1145/3497775.3503692}, we proposed a way to
% synthesize complex logical inferences through \emph{drag-and-drop} actions
% between two items of the current goal. Since goals are represented as
% \emph{sequents} $\Gamma \vdash C$, the items involved were traditional logical
% formulas, either two hypotheses in $\Gamma$ or one hypothesis and the conclusion
% $C$.

% \subsection{Non-symbolic reasoning}

% In this work we show that sequents and formulas built from binary connectives
% and quantifiers are unnecessary for representing the proof state. We speculate
% that they actually get in the way of a natural flow of information in the proof,
% and do not capture accurately the way mathematicians organise hypotheses and
% conclusions in their reasoning. A similar argument has been made by E. Ayers in
% his thesis \sidecite{ayers_thesis}, where his solution is to design a nested goal
% data structure called \texttt{Box} on which reasoning can be performed directly
% without relying on formulas.

% % TODO: reference precise chapter of Ayers thesis

% We introduce a closely related structure for goals, but inspired instead by an
% early invention in the history of graphical logic: the \emph{existential graphs}
% of C. S. Peirce \sidecite{Roberts+1973} (thereafter written ``EGs'').
% We noticed that our structure could be drawn and manipulated metaphorically in
% the form of nested \emph{flowers}, and thus decided to name \emph{flower
% calculus} the proof system that we built around it. Our focus in this work will
% be to study the fundamental properties of the flower calculus, mainly through
% the lens of modern structural proof theory. We only hint at some ways the
% calculus could be used as a foundation for a graphical theorem proving
% interface, and leave a more systematic proposal for future work.

\subsection*{TODO}

\begin{description}
  \item[Explanatory prose] The remaining content of this draft is essentially a
  terse, self-contained definition of the flower calculus, together with a
  relatively detailed proof of completeness. Already written sections will
  benefit from additional text explaining and motivating various definitions,
  lemmas and theorems.
  
  \item[Graphical exposition] The first three sections, which shall expose the
  origins and graphical intuitions behind the flower calculus, remain to be
  written. The `Syntax' section is only temporary, and will ultimately be
  merged/scattered throughout these first three sections.

  \item[Soundness] We have a detailed proof of soundness on paper, which still
  remains to be typeset in \LaTeX.
  
  \item[Conclusion] The conclusion section also remains to be written. Precise
  related works and lines of future research have not been chosen yet, although
  we have a good pool of candidates.

\section{Existential graphs}\labsec{EGs}

\todo{ give a brief presentation of the original diagrammatic system \sys{Alpha}
of EGs for classical propositional logic, together with a reformulation as a
rewriting system on arbitrary (finite) trees.}

Peirce is famous for his contributions to symbolic logic, including among others
his eponymous law for classical logic, and his pioneering work on the algebra of
relations and quantification \sidecite{peirce_algebra_1885}. But far less
widespread are his achievements in the realm of graphical logic, or \emph{iconic
logic} as he called it. He dedicated a large chunk of his life investigating
diagrammatic systems, starting in 1882 with the \emph{entitative graphs} and
culminating with the \emph{existential graphs}, which he developed from 1896
until his death in 1914 \sidecite{Roberts+1973}. Interestingly, Peirce perceived
EGs as his \textit{``chef d'oeuvre''}, and that they \textit{``ought to be the
logic of the future''}\sidenote{Both citations are sourced in page 11 of
\cite{Roberts+1973}}.

Recent works have started to realize this vision: for example Sowa based his
conceptual graphs for computerized knowledge representation on EGs
\sidecite{sowa_conceptual_1976}, Brady, Trimble
\sidecite{brady_categorical_2000}\sidecite{brady_string_nodate} and Haydon,
SobociÅski \sidecite{pietarinen_compositional_2020} proposed various
reconstructions of EGs through the lens of \emph{topology} and \emph{category
theory}, and MelliÃ¨s and Zeilberger \sidecite{mellies_bifibrational_2016}
refined this interpretation by making connections with \emph{linear
logic}\sidenote{We also know through private communication that N. Haydon is
actively working on more explicit links between linear logic and the original
formulation of EGs by Peirce.}\sidecite{girard-linear-1987}. The full story has
yet to be told, but we hope that this work will constitute one more step towards
the vision Peirce had in mind.

\section*{Syntax}

\todo{What should be done with this section?}

\begin{definition}[First-order signature]
  A \emph{first-order signature} is a triplet $\mathcal{\Sigma} = (
  \fsymbs, \psymbs, \arity )$, where $\fsymbs$ and $\psymbs$ are
  respectively the countable sets of \emph{function} and \emph{predicate}
  symbols of $\Sigma$, and $\arity : \fsymbs \cup \psymbs \to \nats$ gives an
  \emph{arity} to each symbol.
\end{definition}

In the following, we assume given a denumerable set of variables $\vars$
and a first-order signature $\Sigma$.

\begin{definition}[Terms]
  The set of terms $\terms$ is defined inductively as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{(Variable)}} If $x \in \vars$ then $x \in \terms$;
    \item{\textbf{(Application)}} If $f \in \fsymbs$ and $\tvec{t}
    \in \terms^{\arity(f)}$, then $f(\tvec{t}) \in \terms$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Flowers]\label{def:flowers}
  The sets of \emph{flowers} $\flowers$ and \emph{gardens} $\gardens$ are
  defined mutually inductively as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{(Atom)}} If $p \in \psymbs$ and $\tvec{t} \in
    \terms^{\arity(p)}$, then $p(\tvec{t}) \in \flowers$;
    \item{\textbf{(Garden)}} If $\mathbf{x} \subset \vars$ is a finite set and $\Phi
    \subset \flowers$ a finite multiset, then $\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi} \in
    \gardens$;
    \item{\textbf{(Flower)}} If $\gamma \in \gardens$ and $\Delta \subset \gardens$
    is a finite multiset, then $\flower{\gamma}{\Delta} \in \flowers$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Any finite set $\mathbf{x} \subset \vars$ of variables is called a
\emph{sprinkler}, finite multiset $\Phi \subset \flowers$ of flowers a
\emph{bouquet}, and finite multiset $\Gamma \subset \gardens$ of gardens a
\emph{corolla}. We will often write gardens as $\garden{x_1, \ldots,
x_n}{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m}$, where the $x_i$ are called \emph{binders}; and
non-atomic flowers as $\flower{\gamma}{\delta_1 \sep \ldots \sep \delta_n}$,
where $\gamma$ is the \emph{pistil}, and the $\delta_i$ are called
\emph{petals}. We write $\fset{i}{n}{E_i}$ to denote a finite (multi)set of
size $n$ with elements $E_i$ indexed by $1 \leq i \leq n$. We also omit
writing the empty (multi)set, accounting for it with blank space as is done in
sequent notation or in Peirce's EGs; in particular, $\garden{{}}{{}}$ stands for
the empty garden $\garden{\emptyset}{\emptyset}$, $\flower{\gamma}{{}}$ for the
flower with no petals $\flower{\gamma}{\emptyset}$, and
$\flower{\gamma}{\garden{{}}{{}}}$ for the flower with one empty petal.

Note that the order of precedence of operators is
$\mathop{,} < \garden{{}}{{}} < \mathop{;} < \mathop{\flower{}{}}$
so that for instance, the string
$$\flower{\garden{x_1, x_2}{\phi_1, \phi_2}}{\garden{y_1}{\psi, (\flower{\gamma}{\Delta})} \sep \garden{y_2}{\Phi}}$$
is parsed as the flower
$$\left(\flower{\left(\garden{\{x_1, x_2\}}{\{\phi_1,
\phi_2\}}\right)}{\{\left(\garden{\{y_1\}}{\{\psi,
\left(\flower{\gamma}{\Delta}\right)\}}\right) \sep
\left(\garden{\{y_2\}}{\Phi}\right)\}}\right)$$ where constructed finite
(multi)sets are delimited with $\{\}$, and constructed flowers/gardens are
delimited with $()$.

\begin{remark}
  In some places the choice of letter for meta-variables will be important to
  disambiguate the kind of syntactic object we denote. \reftab{letters}
  summarizes our chosen notational conventions in this respect.

\begin{definition}[Free variables]\label{def:fv}
  The sets of \emph{free variables} $\fv(-)$ of a term, flower or garden are
  defined mutually inductively as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \fv(x) &= \{x\} \\
    \fv(f(\tvec{t})) &= \bigcup_{t \in \tvec{t}}{\fv(t)} \\
    \fv(p(\tvec{t})) &= \bigcup_{t \in \tvec{t}}{\fv(t)} \\
    \fv(\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}) &= \bigcup_{\phi \in \Phi}{\fv(\phi)} \setminus \mathbf{x} \\
    \fv(\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\Delta}) &= \fv(\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}) \cup \bigcup_{\garden{\mathbf{y}}{\Psi} \in \Delta}{\fv(\garden{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}}{\Psi})}
  \end{align*}
  We say that a term, flower or garden is \emph{closed} when its set of free
  variables is empty. The sets of closed terms, flowers and gardens are denoted
  respectively by $\closed{\terms}$, $\closed{\flowers}$ and $\closed{\gardens}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bound variables]
  % The set of \emph{bound variables} $\bv(\Phi\hole)$ of a context $\Phi\hole$ is defined
  % inductively as follows:
  % \begin{align*}
  %   \bv(\Psi, \hole) &= \emptyset \\
  %   \bv(\Psi, (\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{X}}{\Delta})) &= \mathbf{x} \cup \bv(X) \\
  %   \bv(\Psi, (\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\garden{\mathbf{y}}{X} \sep \Delta})) &= \mathbf{x} \cup \mathbf{y} \cup \bv(X)
  % \end{align*}
  The set of bound variables $\bv(\phi)$ (resp. $\bv(\gamma)$) of a
  flower $\phi$ (resp. garden $\gamma$) is defined by mutual induction as
  follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \bv(p(\tvec{t})) &= \emptyset \\
    \bv(\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}) &= \mathbf{x} \cup \bigcup_{\phi \in \Phi}{\bv(\phi)} \\
    \bv(\flower{\gamma}{\Delta}) &= \bv(\gamma) \cup \bigcup_{\delta \in \Delta}{\bv(\delta)}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Function update]
  Let $A, B$ be two sets, $f, g : A \to B$ two functions and $R \subseteq A$
  some subset of their domain. The \emph{update} of $f$ on $R$ with $g$ is the
  function defined by:
  $$
  \update{f}{R}{g}(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    g(x) &\text{if $x \in R$} \\
    f(x) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  $\update{-}{-}{-}$ is obviously associative, that is
  $\update{f}{R}{(\update{g}{S}{h})} = \update{(\update{f}{R}{g})}{S}{h}$. Also
  if $f$ or $g$ is the identity function $\idsubst$ we omit writing it, i.e.
  $\update{f}{R}{} = \update{f}{R}{\idsubst}$ and $\update{}{R}{g} =
  \update{\idsubst}{R}{g}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Substitution]
  A \emph{substitution} is a function $\sigma : \vars \to \terms$ with a finite
  \emph{support} $\dom(\sigma) = \compr{x}{\sigma(x) \not= x}$. By abuse of
  notation, we will write $\sigma : \mathbf{x} \to \terms$ to denote a
  substitution $\sigma$ whose support is $\mathbf{x}$.
  The domain of substitutions is extended to terms, flowers and gardens
  inductively as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \sigma(f(\tvec{t})) &= f(\sigma(\tvec{t})) \\
    \sigma(p(\tvec{t})) &= p(\sigma(\tvec{t})) \\
    \sigma(\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}) &=
      \garden{\mathbf{x}}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi)} \\
    \sigma(\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\Delta}) &=
      \flower{\sigma(\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi})}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Delta)}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}


\section{Calculus}\labsec{Calculus}

\todo{ introduce formally the full set of inference rules of the flower calculus
as well as our notion of proof, both motivated by analyticity concerns. We also
prove a few useful syntactic properties of our system, including a deduction
theorem.}

\begin{definition}[Context]
  A \emph{context} $\Phi\hole$ is a bouquet such that there is a unique flower
  $\phi \in \Phi\hole$ which contains exactly 1 distinguished 0-ary atom $\hole$
  called the \emph{hole} of $\Phi\hole$. This hole can always be \emph{filled}
  (substituted) with any other bouquet $\Psi$ or context $\Xi\hole$, producing a
  new bouquet $\cfill{\Phi}{\Psi}$ or context $\cfill{\Phi}{\Xi\hole}$. In
  particular, filling with the empty bouquet will yield a bouquet
  $\cfill{\Phi}{\phantom{\Phi}}$, which is just $\Phi\hole$ with its hole removed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Parity]
  The \emph{parity} $\parity{\Phi\hole}$ of a context $\Phi\hole$ is defined inductively by:
  \begin{align*}
    \parity{\Phi, \hole} &= 0 \\
    \parity{\Phi, (\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{Y}}{\Delta})} &= \parity{Y} + 1 \\
    \parity{\Phi, (\flower{\gamma}{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{Y} \sep \Delta})} &= \parity{Y}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Polarity]
  We say that a context $\Phi\hole$ is \emph{positive} if $\parity{\Phi\hole}$ is even, and
  \emph{negative} otherwise. We denote positive and negative contexts
  respectively by $\Phi^+\hole$ and $\Phi^-\hole$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hypothesis]
  We say that a flower $\phi$ is a \emph{hypothesis} of a context $\Phi\hole$, written
  $\chyp{\phi}{\Phi\hole}$, when there exist a bouquet $\Phi$ with $\phi \in \Phi$ and
  contexts $Y$ and $Z$ such that either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Phi\hole = \cfill{Y}{\Phi, Z}$;
    \item $\Phi\hole =
    \cfill{Y}{\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\garden{\mathbf{y}}{Z}
    \sep \Delta}}$ for some $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \Delta$.
  \end{itemize}
  A bouquet $\Psi$ is said to be \emph{available} in $\Phi\hole$, written
  $\chyp{\Psi}{\Phi\hole}$, if $\chyp{\psi}{\Phi\hole}$ for all $\psi \in \Psi$.
\end{definition}

To avoid reasoning about $\alpha$-equivalence, we adopt in this work the
so-called \emph{Barendregt convention} that all variable binders are distinct,
both among themselves and from eventual free variables. Formally, we assume that
for any flower $\phi$, the two following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item computing $\bv(\phi)$ as a multiset gives the same result as computing
  it as a set;
  \item $\bv(\phi) \cap \fv(\phi) = \emptyset$.
\end{enumerate} 
% To preserve this convention, in this paper we will only consider
% \emph{non-circular} substitutions $\sigma$ where $x \not\in \fv(\sigma(x))$ for
% all $x \in \dom(\sigma)$.

The central device studied in this work, the \emph{flower calculus}, can be
described as a \emph{rewrite system} on bouquets. That is, one has a finite
number of rewrite rules which are families (schemas) of pairs of bouquets, and
these can be applied and composed in a directed way to derive new bouquets.
Intuitively, a rewriting step $\Phi \rightarrow \Psi$ should be understood as an
act of \emph{backward inference}: starting from the goal $\Phi$ that I want to
prove, I transform it into a new goal $\Psi$ which is a sufficient justification
of $\Phi$, and hopefully simpler to prove.

\todo{Graphical version of \reffig{flower-calculus}}

To emphasize this viewpoint, the calculus is presented in figure
\reffig{flower-calculus} as a set of unary \emph{inference rules}: when read
\emph{top-down}, they correspond to usual inferences from premiss to conclusion,
and will be justified by the soundness theorem of section \refsec{Soundness}.
% This gives them a \emph{static}, \emph{a posteriori} meaning, since this is
% typically how you would check the validity of an established inference
% \emph{after the fact}.
But the more interesting direction, and the one around which the calculus has
been designed, is when you read the rules \emph{bottom-up}: then they are indeed
rewrite rules, telling you the different ways in which you can choose to
simplify a goal.

\begin{definition}[Derivation]
  Given a set of rules $\mathsf{R}$, we write $\Phi \step_{\mathsf{R}} \Psi$ to
  indicate a rewrite \emph{step} in $\mathsf{R}$, that is an instance of some
  $\mathsf{r} \in \mathsf{R}$ with $\Psi$ as premiss and $\Phi$ as conclusion.
  The rules of the flower calculus are divided into two sets: the \emph{natural}
  rules $\Nature$, and the \emph{cultural} rules $\Culture$. We just write $\Phi
  \step \Psi$ to mean $\Phi \step_{\Nature\cup\Culture} \Psi$. A
  \emph{derivation} $\Phi \nsteps{n}_{\mathsf{R}} \Psi$ is a sequence of rewrite
  steps $\Phi_0 \step_{\mathsf{R}} \Phi_1 \ldots \step_{\mathsf{R}} \Phi_n$ with
  $\Phi_0 = \Phi$, $\Phi_n = \Psi$ and $n \geq 0$. Generally the length $n$ of
  the derivation does not matter, and we just write $\Phi \steps_R \Psi$.
  Finally, natural derivations are closed under arbitrary contexts: for every
  context $\Xi\hole$, $\Phi \step_\Nature \Psi$ implies $\cfill{\Xi}{\Phi}
  \step_\Nature \cfill{\Xi}{\Psi}$.
\end{definition}

\todo{Use the $\lstep$ notation for local steps}

\begin{definition}[Proof]
  A \emph{proof} of a bouquet $\Phi$ is a derivation $\Phi \steps \emptyset$.
\end{definition}

In Peircean terms, the empty bouquet is the blank \emph{sheet of assertion},
which symbolizes \emph{absolute truth}. Then in our proof construction paradigm,
proving a bouquet amounts to erasing it completely from the sheet of assertion,
thus reducing it to absolute truth.

Now if we want to speak about \emph{relative} truth $\Psi \vdash \Phi$, i.e.
$\Phi$ is true under the assumption that $\Psi$ is, it turns out that the notion
of syntactic derivability $\Phi \steps \Psi$ is too weak. Indeed as we will see
in section \refsec{Soundness}, all rules of the flower calculus are
\emph{invertible}. A consequence is that derivability is only able to relate
logically equivalent bouquets --- in fact not even all of them --- which
prevents the applicability of the \emph{deduction theorem}
\ref{thm:deduction}\sidenote{This problem does not arise in the EGs of Peirce,
because of the powerful but non-invertible rules of \emph{insertion} and
\emph{deletion}.}.

A trivial way to circumvent this is to define directly $\Psi \vdash \Phi$ as
$\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}} \steps \emptyset$. In fact this is
closer to what one would find in sequent calculus, where hypothetical proofs are
closed derivations of hypothetical sequents, not open derivations. The
difference is that sequents capture only the implicative structure of logic,
while flowers capture the full structure of first-order intuitionistic logic.
This allows for a nice generalization of the notion of hypothetical provability,
which will be useful in the completeness proof of section
\refsec{Completeness}. 

\begin{definition}[Hypothetical provability]
  Given two bouquets $\Phi, \Psi$, we say that $\Phi$ is \emph{hypothetically
  provable} from $\Psi$ in a fragment $\mathsf{R}$ of rules, written $\Psi
  \vdash_{\mathsf{R}} \Phi$, if for every context $\Xi\hole$ such that
  $\chyp{\Psi}{\Xi\hole}$, $\cfill{\Xi}{\Phi} \steps_{\mathsf{R}}
  \cfill{\Xi}{\phantom{\Phi}}$. We write $\Phi \vdash \Psi$ to denote hypothetical provability
  in the full flower calculus.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Reflexivity]\label{thm:reflexivity}
  For any bouquet $\Phi$, $\Phi \vdash \Phi$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For any context $\Xi\hole$ such that $\chyp{\Phi}{\Xi\hole}$, one has the following
  derivation:
  $$
  \cfill{\Xi}{\Phi} \step_{\mathsf{poll{\downarrow}}}
  \cfill{\Xi}{\phantom{\Phi}}
  $$
\end{proof}

There is a subtle but important shift here with respect to the standard notions
of hypothetical provability, as found in Gentzen systems or type theories: while
in these settings it is characterized as the existence of a proof for a
\emph{single} hypothetical judgment $\Gamma \vdash C$ which constrains the space
of derivations, here we have the stronger requirement that there exist proofs
for a \emph{class} of judgments $\cfill{\Xi}{\Phi}$, whose hypothetical shape
comes from the condition that $\chyp{\Psi}{\Xi\hole}$. In practice, the
pollination rules $\{\text{\rnmsf{poll{\downarrow}}},
\text{\rnmsf{poll{\uparrow}}}\}$ and the {\rnmsf{fence}} rule make this equivalent
to the existence of a proof for $\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}$. But
we conjecture that the {\rnmsf{fence}} rule might be admissible modulo the
addition of the following distributivity rule:
$$
\R[\textsf{wrep}]
  {\flower{\gamma}{\fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathbf{x_i}}{\Phi_i, \Psi}}}}
  {(\flower{\gamma}{\fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathbf{x_i}}{\Phi_i}}}), \Psi}
$$
Thus our stronger notion of hypothetical provability makes more sense in the
variant $\Nature \setminus \{\rsf{fence}\} \cup \{\rsf{wrep}\}$ of the flower
calculus, although it will still be useful in this work to make meta-theoretical
proofs slightly shorter. For now we allow the {\rnmsf{fence}} rule, which makes
the deduction theorem trivial:

\begin{theorem}[Deduction]\label{thm:deduction}
  For any pair $\Phi, \Psi$ of bouquets, $\Psi \vdash \Phi$ if and only if
  $\vdash \flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\Xi\hole$ be some context. If $\Psi \vdash \Phi$, then in particular
  $\cfill{Y}{\Phi} \steps \cfill{Y}{\phantom{\Phi}}$ for $\Xi'\hole :=
  \cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\square}}}$. Thus we have:
  $$
  \cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}} \steps
  \cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{}}} \step_{\mathsf{epet}}
  \cfill{\Xi}{\phantom{\Phi}}
  $$
  In the other direction, let $\Xi$ be some context such that
  $\chyp{\Psi}{\Xi\hole}$. If $\vdash
  \flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}$, then in particular
  $\cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}} \steps
  \cfill{\Xi}{\phantom{\Phi}}$. Thus we have:
  $$
  \cfill{\Xi}{\Phi} \step_{\mathsf{fence}}
  \cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{{}}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}} \step_{\mathsf{poll{\uparrow}}}
  \cfill{\Xi}{\flower{\garden{{}}{\Psi}}{\garden{{}}{\Phi}}} \steps
  \cfill{\Xi}{\phantom{\Phi}}
  $$
\end{proof}


\section{Kripke Semantics}\labsec{Semantics}

\todo{ give a direct Kripke semantics to flowers, avoiding the need for
translations to and from traditional formulas. This will be crucial to get a
strong completeness theorem.}

\begin{definition}[First-order structure]
  A \emph{first-order structure} is a pair $( M, \interp{\cdot} )$
  where $M$ is a non-empty set, and $\interp{\cdot}$ is a map called the
  \emph{interpretation} that associates to each function symbol $f \in \fsymbs$
  a function $\interp{f} : M^{\arity(f)} \to M$, and to each predicate symbol $p
  \in \psymbs$ a relation $\interp{p} \subseteq M^{\arity(p)}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Kripke structure]
  A \emph{Kripke Structure} is a triplet $\mathcal{K} = ( W, \access,
  (M_w)_{w \in W} )$, where $W$ is the set of \emph{worlds}, $\access$ is
  a pre-order on $W$ called \emph{accessibility}, and $(M_w)_{w \in W}$ is a
  family of first-order structures indexed by $W$. Furthermore, we require the
  following monotonicity conditions to hold whenever $w \access w'$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $M_w \subseteq M_{w'}$;
    \item for every $f \in \fsymbs$, $\interp{f}_w \subseteq
      \interp{f}_{w'}$;
    \item for every $p \in \psymbs$, $\interp{p}_w \subseteq
      \interp{p}_{w'}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$w$-evaluation]
  Given a Kripke structure $\mathcal{K}$ and a world $w$ in $\mathcal{K}$, a
  \emph{$w$-evaluation} is a function $e : \mathcal{V} \to M_w$.
  % We write $e : \mathbf{x} \to M_w$ if $e(x) = \ast$ for every $x \not\in
  % \mathbf{x}$ and some distinguished element $\ast \in M_w$.
  The interpretation map of $M_w$ is extended to terms with respect to any
  evaluation $e$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
  \interp{x}_e &= e(x) \\
  \interp{f(\tvec{t})}_e &= \interp{f}_w(\interp{\tvec{t}}_e)
  % \interp{p(t_1, \ldots, t_n)}_e &~\text{iff}~ (\interp{t_1}_e, \ldots, \interp{t_n}_e) \in \interp{p}_w \\
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Forcing]\label{def:forcing}

  Given some Kripke structure $\mathcal{K}$, the \emph{forcing} relation
  $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e}$ between a world $w$, a flower $\phi$ and a
  $w$-evaluation $e$ is defined by induction on $\phi$ as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\eforces{w}{p(\tvec{t})}{e}$ iff $\interp{\tvec{t}}_e \in \interp{p}_w$;
    \item
    $\eforces{w}{\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathbf{x}_i}{\Phi_i}}}}{e}$ iff for every $w' \geq
    w$ and every $w'$-evaluation $e'$, if
    $\eforces{w'}{\Phi}{\update{e}{\mathbf{x}}{e'}} $ then there is some $1
    \leq i \leq n$ and $w'$-evaluation $e''$ such that
    $\eforces{w'}{\Phi_i}{\update{\update{e}{\mathbf{x}}{e'}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{e''}}$;
    \item $\eforces{w}{\Phi}{e}$ iff $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e}$ for every $\phi \in
    \Phi$.
  \end{itemize}
  We write $w \forces \Phi$ if $\eforces{w}{\Phi}{e}$ for every $w$-evaluation
  $e$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:closed-forcing}
  
  For any closed flower $\phi \in \closed{\flowers}$ and $w$-evaluations $e,
  e'$, if $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e}$ then $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e'}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By a straightforward induction on $\phi$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}[Closed forcing]
  
%   For any closed flower $\phi \in \closed{\flowers}$, $w \forces \phi$ iff
%   $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e}$ for some $w$-evaluation $e$.
% \end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Semantic entailment]
  Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a Kripke structure, and $\Phi, \Psi$ some bouquets. We
  say that $\Phi$ \emph{entails} $\Psi$ in $\mathcal{K}$, written $\Phi
  \vDash_{\mathcal{K}} \Psi$, when $\eforces{w}{\Phi}{e}$ implies
  $\eforces{w}{\Psi}{e}$ for every world $w \in W$ and $w$-evaluation $e$. This
  entailment is \emph{valid} if it holds for any Kripke structure $\mathcal{K}$,
  and in that case we simply write $\Phi \vDash \Psi$.
\end{definition}


\section{Soundness}\labsec{Soundness}

\todo{ show that all the rules of the flower calculus are valid with respect to
our Kripke semantics.}

\begin{lemma}[Natural soundness]

EGs. A corollary is that the flower calculus is \emph{analytic}, in a sense very
close to that coined by Gentzen.}

\subsection{Theories}

\begin{definition}[Theory]\label{def:theory} 
  
  Any set $T \subseteq \flowers$ of flowers is called a \emph{theory}. In
  particular, a bouquet can be regarded as a finite theory, by forgetting the
  number of repetitions of its elements. We say that a bouquet $\Phi$ is
  \emph{provable from} a theory $T$, written $T \vdash \Phi$, if there exists a
  bouquet $\Psi \subseteq T$ such that $\Psi \vdash \Phi$. Given a Kripke
  structure $\mathcal{K}$, a world $w$ in $\mathcal{K}$ and a $w$-evaluation
  $e$, we say that $T$ is \emph{forced} by $w$ under $e$, written
  $\eforces{w}{T}{e}$, if $\eforces{w}{\phi}{e}$ for all $\phi \in T$. Then
  $\Phi$ is a \emph{consequence} of $T$, written $T \vDash_{\mathcal{K}} \Phi$,
  if $\eforces{w}{T}{e}$ implies $\eforces{w}{\Phi}{e}$ for every world $w$ in
  $\mathcal{K}$ and $w$-evaluation $e$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Weakening]\label{thm:weakening}
  If $T \subseteq T'$ and $T \vdash \phi$, then $T' \vdash \phi$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This follows immediately from our definition of provability from a theory
  \ref{def:theory}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[$\psi$-consistency]
  A theory $T$ is \emph{$\psi$-consistent} when $T \nvdash_\Nature \psi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$\psi$-completeness]
  A theory $T$ is \emph{$\psi$-complete} when for all $\phi \in \flowers$,
  either $T, \phi \vdash_\Nature \psi$ or $\phi \in T$.
\end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[$\psi$-Henkin]
%   A theory $T$ is \emph{$\psi$-Henkin} when for all $\phi =
%   \flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\garden{\mathbf{x}_1}{\Phi_1} \sep \ldots
%   \sep \garden{\mathbf{x}_n}{\Phi_n}} \in T$ and $\sigma : \mathbf{x} \to
%   \closed{\terms}$, if $T, \sigma(\Phi) \nvdash \psi$ then there are some $1
%   \leq i \leq n$ and $\sigma_i : \mathbf{x}_i \to \closed{\terms}$ such that
%   $\sigma_i \circ \sigma(\Phi_i) \subseteq T$.
% \end{definition}

\subsection{Completion}

In the following, we suppose some enumeration $(\phi_n)_{n \in \nats}$ of
$\flowers$, which should be definable constructively given the
inductive nature of flowers \ref{def:flowers}.

Let $\psi \in \flowers$, and $T$ a $\psi$-consistent theory. We now
define a \emph{completion} procedure which constructs an extension
$\completion{T} \supseteq T$ with the property that $\completion{T}$ is
$\psi$-consistent and $\psi$-complete.

\begin{definition}[$n$-completion]
  The \emph{$n$-completion} $\ncompletion{T}{n}$ of $T$ is defined recursively
  as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \ncompletion{T}{0} &= T \\
    \ncompletion{T}{n+1} &=
    \begin{cases}
      \ncompletion{T}{n} \cup \phi_n &\text{if $\ncompletion{T}{n} \cup \phi_n$ is $\psi$-consistent} \\
      \ncompletion{T}{n} &\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Completion]
  The \emph{completion} $\completion{T}$ of $T$ is the denumerable union of all
  $n$-completions:
  $$\completion{T} = \bigcup_{n \in \nats}{\ncompletion{T}{n}}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:completion-consistent}
  $\completion{T}$ is $\psi$-consistent.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  It is immediate by recurrence on $n$ that $\ncompletion{T}{n}$ is
  $\psi$-consistent. Then suppose that $\completion{T} \vdash_\Nature \psi$, that is
  there is some bouquet $\Phi \subseteq \completion{T}$ such that $\Phi \vdash_\Nature
  \psi$. For each $\phi \in \Phi$, there is some rank $n$ such that $\phi \in
  \ncompletion{T}{n}$. Let $m$ be the greatest such rank. Then $\Phi \subseteq
  \ncompletion{T}{m}$, and thus by weakening \ref{thm:weakening} $\Phi \nvdash_\Nature
  \psi$. Contradiction.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{thm:completion-complete}
  $\completion{T}$ is $\psi$-complete.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that there is some $\phi$ such that $\completion{T}, \phi \nvdash_\Nature
  \psi$ and $\phi \not\in \completion{T}$, and let $\phi = \phi_n$. Then
  $\completion{T} \cup \phi_n$ is $\psi$-consistent, and thus by weakening
  \ref{thm:weakening} so is $\ncompletion{T}{n} \cup \phi_n$. This entails that
  $\phi_n \in \ncompletion{T}{n+1} \subseteq \completion{T}$. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Adequacy}

We now define the so-called \emph{universal Kripke structure} $\rewolF{\psi}$
relative to a flower $\psi$, which will satisfy the property that $\Phi
\vDash_{\rewolF{\psi}} \Psi$ implies $\Phi \vDash \Psi$ for any $\psi$.

\begin{definition}[Universal Kripke structure]\label{def:kcanon}
  Let $\psi \in \flowers$. The \emph{universal Kripke structure}
  $\rewolF{\psi}$ has:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The set of $\psi$-consistent and $\psi$-complete theories as its worlds;
    \item Set inclusion as its accessibility relation;
    \item For each world $T$, a first-order structure whose domain is the set of
    terms $\terms$, and whose interpretation map is given by:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\interp{f}(\tvec{t}) = f(\tvec{t})$
        \item $\interp{p} = \compr{\tvec{t}}{p(\tvec{t}) \in T}$
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  One can easily check that the monotonicity conditions of Kripke structures
  hold for $\rewolF{\psi}$.
\end{definition}

% \newcommand{\ids}{\update{\idsubst}{\mathbf{x}}{\sigma}}
\begin{proposition}\label{thm:inv-elem-flower}
  
  Let $\psi \in \flowers$, $T$ some $\psi$-consistent and $\psi$-complete
  theory, and $\phi = \flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\Delta}$ with $\Delta
  = \fset{i}{n}{\delta_i} = \fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathbf{x}_i}{\Phi_i}}$ such
  that $\phi \in T$. Then for every substitution $\sigma : \mathbf{x} \to
  \terms$, either $\sigma(\Phi_i) \subseteq T$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$, or $T
  \nvdash_\Nature \sigma(\Phi)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose the contrary, i.e. there is a substitution $\sigma$ such that $T
  \vdash_\Nature \sigma(\Phi)$ and for all $1 \leq i \leq n$, there is some $\phi_i \in
  \Phi_i$ such that $\sigma(\phi_i) \not\in T$. Thus by $\psi$-completeness of
  $T$, we get $T, \sigma(\phi_i) \vdash_\Nature \psi$. So there are $\Psi \subseteq T$
  and $\Psi_i \subseteq T \cup \sigma(\phi_i)$ such that $\Psi \vdash_\Nature
  \sigma(\Phi)$ and $\Psi_i \vdash_\Nature \psi$. Now it cannot be the case that $\Psi_i
  \subseteq T$, otherwise by weakening and $\psi$-consistency of $T$ we would
  have $\Psi_i \nvdash_\Nature \psi$. So there must exist $\Psi_i' \subseteq T$ such
  that $\Psi_i = \Psi_i' \cup \sigma(\phi_i)$. Let $\Xi = \bigcup_{i =
  1}^{n}{\Psi_i'}$. Again by weakening and $\psi$-consistency of $T$, we get
  $\Psi, \Xi, \phi \nvdash_\Nature \psi$. Now we derive a contradiction by showing
  $\Psi, \Xi, \phi \vdash_\Nature \psi$. Let $X$ be a context such that $\chyp{\Psi,
  \Xi, \phi}{X}$. Then $\cfill{X}{\psi} \steps_\Nature \cfill{X}{\phantom{\Phi}}$ with the following
  derivation:

  that $T \nvdash_\Nature \phi$. Then for every $1 \leq i \leq n$ and substitution

  Suppose the contrary, i.e. there are some $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $\sigma :

  $$
  \begin{array}{rll}
    \cfill{X}{\phi}
    &\step_{\mathsf{ipet}} &\cfill{X}{\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\garden{{}}{\sigma(\Phi_i)} \sep \Delta}} \\
    &\step_{\mathsf{poll}{\downarrow}} &\cfill{X}{\flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\garden{{}}{\phantom{\Phi}} \sep \Delta}} \\
    &\step_{\mathsf{epet}} &\cfill{X}{\phantom{\Phi}}
  \end{array}
  $$

\begin{lemma}[Adequacy]\label{thm:adequacy}

  Let $\phi, \psi \in \flowers$, $T$ a $\psi$-consistent and $\psi$-complete
  theory, and $\sigma$ a subtitution such that $\fv(\sigma(x)) \cap \bv(\phi) =
  \emptyset$ for any variable $x$. Then
  \begin{enumerate*}
    \item $\sigma(\phi) \in T$ implies $\eforces{T}{\phi}{\sigma}$, and
    \item $T \nvdash_\Nature \sigma(\phi)$ implies $\neforces{T}{\phi}{\sigma}$
  \end{enumerate*}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on $\phi$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi = p(\tvec{t})$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item By definition of forcing \ref{def:forcing} and $\rewolF{\psi}$
      \ref{def:kcanon}, $\eforces{T}{p(\tvec{t})}{\sigma}$ precisely when
      $\sigma(p(\tvec{t})) \in T$.
      \item Suppose that $\eforces{T}{\phi}{\sigma}$, that is $\sigma(\phi) \in
      T$. Then by weakening, we get $\sigma(\phi) \nvdash_\Nature \sigma(\phi)$. But
      this is impossible by reflexivity of $\vdash$ \ref{thm:reflexivity}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item $\phi =
    \flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\Phi}}{\fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathcal{X_i}}{\Phi_i}}}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $U \supseteq T$ be a $\psi$-consistent and $\psi$-complete
      theory. Obviously $\sigma(\phi) =
      \flower{\garden{\mathbf{x}}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi)}}{\fset{i}{n}{\garden{\mathbf{x}_i}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}
      \cup \mathbf{x}_i}(\Phi_i)}}} \in U$, and thus by proposition
      \ref{thm:inv-elem-flower}, for every substitution $\tau$, either $
      \update{}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau} \circ \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x} \cup
      \mathbf{x}_i}(\Phi_i) =
      \update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{}(\Phi_i)
      \subseteq U$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$, or $U \nvdash_\Nature \update{}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau} \circ
      \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi) =
      \update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau}(\Phi)$. In the first case, we get
      $\eforces{U}{\Phi_i}{\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{}}$
      by induction hypothesis. In the second case, we get
      $\neforces{U}{\Phi}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}\tau}$ by induction
      hypothesis. In other words,
      $\eforces{U}{\Phi}{\restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}\tau}$ implies
      $\eforces{U}{\Phi_i}{\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{\tau}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{}}$,
      that is $\eforces{T}{\phi}{\sigma}$.
      \item By proposition \ref{thm:inv-deriv-flower}, for every $1 \leq i \leq
      n$ and substitution $\tau$, there is some $\phi_i \in \Phi_i$ such that
      $T, \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi) \nvdash_\Nature
      \update{}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau} \circ \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x} \cup
      \mathbf{x}_i}(\phi_i) =
      \update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau}(\phi_i)$. By
      the completion procedure, we get a theory $U = \completion{T \cup
      \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi)} \supseteq T \cup
      \restr{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}(\Phi)$ which is both
      $\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau}(\phi_i)$-consistent
      and
      $\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau}(\phi_i)$-complete.
      Then by induction hypothesis,
      $\eforces{U}{\Phi}{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}$ since
      $\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}(\Phi) \subseteq U$, and
      $\neforces{U}{\phi_i}{\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau}}$
      since $U$ is
      $\update{\update{\sigma}{\mathbf{x}}{}}{\mathbf{x}_i}{\tau}(\phi_i)$-consistent,
      that is $\neforces{T}{\phi}{\sigma}$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:completeness-contra}
  
  Let $\psi \in \closed{\flowers}$ and $T$ be a $\psi$-consistent closed theory,
  that is every $\phi \in T$ is closed. Then $T \nvDash \psi$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We show $T \nvDash_{\rewolF{\psi}} \psi$, and more specifically that there is
  some substitution $\sigma$ such that $\eforces{\completion{T}}{T}{\sigma}$ but
  $\neforces{\completion{T}}{\psi}{\sigma}$. Let $\sigma \triangleq
  \update{}{\bv(\psi)}{\cstsubst{z}}$ for some fresh variable $z \not\in
  \bv(\psi)$, where $\cstsubst{z}$ is the constant substitution that always maps
  to $z$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $\phi \in T$, and $\tau = \update{}{\bv(\phi)}{\cstsubst{z'}}$ for
    some fresh variable $z' \not\in \bv(\phi)$. It is obviously the case that
    $\tau(\phi) = \phi$ since $\phi$ is closed, and $\fv(\tau(x)) \cap \bv(\phi)
    = \emptyset$ for any variable $x$. Then $\phi \in \completion{T}$, thus by
    $\psi$-consistency \ref{thm:completion-consistent} and $\psi$-completeness
    \ref{thm:completion-complete} of the completion one can apply the adequacy
    lemma \ref{thm:adequacy} to get $\eforces{\completion{T}}{\phi}{\tau}$.
    Hence $\eforces{\completion{T}}{\phi}{\sigma}$ by lemma
    \ref{thm:closed-forcing}.
    \item By the same argument for $\tau$ transposed to $\sigma$, we can apply
    the adequacy lemma \ref{thm:adequacy} to get
    $\neforces{\completion{T}}{\psi}{\sigma}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

We get completeness as a direct corollary of lemma
\ref{thm:completeness-contra}, in the case where $T = \emptyset$:

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
  For any closed flower $\phi$, $\vDash \phi$ implies $\vdash_\Nature \phi$.
\end{theorem}


\section{Automated proof search}\labsec{flowers-search}

\todo{ describe an algorithm for fully automated proof search in the
propositional fragment of the flower calculus, exploiting both its analyticity
and invertibility. The procedure is conjectured to be complete for provability.}


\section{The Flower Prover}\labsec{flowers-prover}

\todo{ give an overview of the Flower Prover, a prototype of GUI in the
Proof-by-Action paradigm whose actions map directly to the rules of the flower
calculus. We also explain how the user can opt in and out of various levels of
automation based on our search procedure, similarly to what was described for
the invertible bubble calculus of \refsec{invertible-calculus}.}


\section{Towards a Curry-Howard correspondence}\labsec{flowers-curryhoward}

\todo{ briefly sketch some ideas for a Curry-Howard correspondence, where
flowers and actions for manipulating them are identified respectively with
\emph{normal} and \emph{neutral} terms of the $\lambda$-calculus. }


\section{Conclusion}\labsec{Conclusion}

\todo{ conclude by a comparison with some related works, and a discussion of
future works and applications that we envision.}

\subsection{Related works}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Iteration/Pollination rule = Absorption rule of focused sequent calculus
  \sidecite{andreoli_logic_1992}.
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that Peirce did not think of EGs as a calculus that could aid
in performing reasoning \emph{per se}, but rather as a tool for analysing the
finer structure of logical endeavor\sidenote{Citing \cite{Roberts+1973} pp.
110-111: \textit{``[...] the purpose which the system was designed to fulfill
was ``to enable us to separate reasoning into its smallest steps so that each
one may be examined by itself'' (Ms 455, p. 2). The aim was not to facilitate
reasoning, but to facilitate the study of reasoning.''}}.

\todo{ explain how we depart from this conception, i.e. by focusing on iteration
(and more generally invertible) rules instead of insertion/deletion rules (which
are even shown to be admissible!), and replacing lines of identity by the more
complex apparatus of substitution. Which explains why we believe \emph{the
opposite}, that EGs \emph{can} form the basis for an ergonomic calculus.}
