As for the asymmetric \kl{bubble calculus} \kl{BJ}, the rules of our full symmetric
\kl{bubble calculus} \kl{system~B} enjoy both a sequent-style and a graphical
presentation, given respectively in \reffig{sequent-B} and \reffig{graphical-B}.
The presence of closed and open \kl{solutions} complicates quite a bit the graphical
representation of rules, thus some explanations are in order:
\begin{description}
  \item[Closed solutions] In \refsec{symm-interp}, we mentioned that closed
\kl{solutions} with no \kl{neutral} \kl{bubbles} can be distinguished visually from open
\kl{solutions} by painting their background in a different color; we chose a light
green, to suggest that they denote \emph{solved} \kl{subgoals}. In
\reffig{graphical-B}, we emphasize systematically the distinction by extending
this convention to all closed \kl{solutions}.
  \item[Generic statuses] As can be seen in \reffig{sequent-B}, many rules of
\kl{system~B} are \emph{generic} over \kl{branching operators} $\J, \JB$, which
determine whether a \kl{solution} is closed or open, i.e. its \emph{status}. The
challenge is thus to find an \kl{iconic} counterpart to the \kl{symbols} $\J, \JB$, that
fulfills the same function of \emph{meta-variable} ranging over \kl{solution}
statuses. Since we already use the background color to represent the status of
concrete \kl{solutions}, we chose to do the same with abstract ones: each new color
other than green will stand for the status of the \kl{solution} associated to the
given location of the canvas. For instance in the \kl{f{-}{+}{\da}}
rule, the status of the ambient \kl{solution} where the rule is applied is denoted by
a light yellow background, while the status of the \kl{solution} $S$ enclosed in a
red \kl{bubble} is denoted by the light pink background.
  \item[Status changes] Last but not least, many rules like \kl{i{\da}} change
the status of the ambient \kl{solution} from open to closed: graphically, this means
that the background must become green \emph{everywhere}, not only in the portion
of the canvas depicted by the rule. At first it might appear as breaking
locality, but it should rather be understood as the result of a perfectly local
and continuous process: one can imagine a literal \emph{drop} of green paint
that soaks a growing portion of the canvas, until it reaches an enclosing \kl{bubble}
--- for the sake of \kl{metaphor}, let us say a cut in the papersheet --- that
stops its progression\sidenote{We will come back to this \emph{cuts in a sheet}
\kl{metaphor}, first introduced by C. S. Peirce, in \refch{eg}. When closing the
top-level \kl{solution} --- Peirce called it the \emph{\kl{sheet of assertion}}, the
drop expansion process becomes \emph{infinite}. I find it to be a beautiful
allegory of the \emph{unreachability} of global, unconditional truth: it is only
by being confined to a finite, well-delimited space, that we can affirm
unequivocally our certainty.
% What lays behind the fences (possibly some hidden assumptions!), out of our
% grasp will stay.
As Wittgenstein famously said at the end of the Tractatus: \textit{``Whereof one
cannot speak, thereof one must be silent''}.}.
\end{description}

We will now analyze the various groups of rules of \kl{system~B}, by
comparing them to those of the \kl{BJ} calculus:
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{\identity}] 
  A first difference, that we will find in most rules of \kl{system~B}, is that
  we rely on the distributive interpretation of conclusions in \kl{solutions}. For
  instance in the \kl{i{\ua}} rule, $\Delta$ is available potentially in
  both \kl{subgoals}, and we do not need to move it manually: this will be the role
  of the flow rules for red \kl{items}.
  
  A second difference is that the rules are not applicable in arbitrary
  \kl{subsolutions}, but only \emph{open} ones. This will also be the case of some
  membrane and heating rules. In the case of the \kl{i{\da}} rule, it
  guarantees its \emph{locality}: if the conclusion was $\Gamma, A \piq{\cS} A,
  \Delta$, then the distributive semantics would entail that all \kl{subgoals} in
  $\cS$ must be solved at once, despite the fact that they are not directly
  related to $A$\sidenote{If we were to give up on locality, we could opt for
  this variant, which gives better \emph{factorizability}. In fact we will
  precisely do that in \refsec{invertible-calculus}.}. As for the
  \kl{i{\ua}} rule, restricting to open \kl{solutions} makes the rule
  \emph{\kl{invertible}}, without sacrificing locality. This will in fact be the case
  of all rules that create multiple \kl{subgoals}.

  \item[\textbf{\resource}] 
  Here we still have \kl{weakening} and \kl{contraction} for \kl{negative} \kl{items} (hypotheses),
  and we also allow them for \kl{positive} \kl{items} (conclusions). Note that contrary to
  the $\mathbb{I}$-rules which apply only to a formula $A$, $\mathbb{R}$-rules
  apply to an arbitrary \kl{item} $I$, which can either be a formula or a \kl{solution}.
  Combined to the fact that the ambient \kl{solution} can be either open or closed,
  this gives the most general and expressive formulation of the rules. We
  believe that like in \kl{CoS}, the atomic version where $I$ is restricted to an
  atomic formula might be sufficient for completeness.

  \item[\textbf{\flow}]

  Compared to \kl{BJ} where we only had \kl{neutral} bubbles, the presence of
  \kl{polarized} \kl{bubbles} in \kl{system~B} creates a mini-combinatorial explosion in
  the number of possible $\mathbb{F}$-rules. Indeed, the general scheme is to
  consider what types of \kl{items} are allowed to flow through bubbles, either
  inwards or outwards. With $i$ \kl{item} types and $b$ \kl{bubble} types, this makes for
  a total of $i \times b \times 2$ possible rules. In \kl{BJ} \kl{items} consisted
  only of \kl{polarized} formulas and \kl{neutral} \kl{bubbles} ($i = 3$ and $b = 1$), thus we
  had a total of $6$ possible $\mathbb{F}$-rules. It turns out that only the
  \kl{f{-}{\da}} rule was necessary, and it is also present in \kl{system
  B}. Now with \kl{positive} and \kl{negative} \kl{bubbles} added to the mix ($b = 3$), we
  get up to a total of $18$ possible $\mathbb{F}$-rules in \kl{system~B}. Out
  of these, $11$ were identified as being sound logically, and thus we decided
  to include all of them in \kl{system~B}.

  \begin{marginfigure}
    % \hspace{0.5em}
    \stkfig{1.3}{bubbles-porosity}
    \caption{Porosity of \kl{bubbles} in \kl{system~B}}
    \labfig{bubbles-porosity}
  \end{marginfigure}
  
  Some of them we have already encountered in \refsec{colors}: first the
  \kl{f{+}{\da}} rule for distributing conclusions in \kl{subgoals}, which
  would not have made sense with the \kl{asymmetric interpretation} of \kl{solutions}
  (\refdef{ainterp}); but also the \kl{f{-}{+}{\da}} and
  \kl{f{+}{-}{\da}} rules, which allow a \kl{polarized} \kl{item} to flow
  \emph{into} a \kl{bubble} of \emph{opposite} \kl{polarity}. However to get
  \emph{cut-free} completeness, we will also need a sort of dual of these rules,
  \kl{f{+}{+}{\ua}} and \kl{f{-}{-}{\ua}}, which allow a \kl{polarized}
  \kl{item} to flow \emph{out} of a \kl{bubble} with the \emph{same} \kl{polarity}. Thus in
  addition to the duality that \emph{swaps} \kl{polarities}
  (\kl{f{-}{+}{\da}} versus \kl{f{+}{-}{\da}}), we have this new
  duality which \emph{reverses} at the same time the \emph{direction} of the
  flow, and the \emph{relationship} between \kl{polarities}
  (\kl{f{-}{+}{\da}} versus \kl{f{+}{+}{\ua}}).

  Taken together, these $6$ rules capture provability in
  \emph{\kl{bi-intuitionistic}} logic, as will be demonstrated by the soundness and
  completeness theorems for \kl{system~B}. By adding any one of the converses
  to the $4$ rules that define the porosity of \kl{polarized} \kl{bubbles} (\kl{f{-}{+}{\ua}}, \kl{f{+}{-}{\ua}}, \kl{f{-}{-}{\da}},
  \kl{f{+}{+}{\da}}), the system collapses to \emph{classical} logic.
  This situation is summarized in \reffig{bubbles-porosity}: as in
  \reffig{bubbles-flow}, green and orange arrows represent respectively valid
  and invalid moves, but in \kl{bi-intuitionistic} rather than \kl{intuitionistic} logic.
  To recover the latter, one can just ignore all arrows that cross the blue
  bubble, which are only useful in \kl{dual-intuitionistic} logic. Then the purple
  arrows represent moves that are valid only in \kl{classical} logic. The reader can
  easily check that there is a total of $18$ arrows, and map the green and
  purple arrows back to the corresponding $\mathbb{F}$-rules of
  \reffig{graphical-B}.

  \begin{remark}
    Since all \kl{items} can freely go in and out of \kl{polarized} \kl{bubbles} in \kl{classical}
    logic, the latter are useless. In fact, one could restrict the syntax of
    \kl{solutions} to \kl{neutral} \kl{bubbles} and only one \kl{polarity} of formulas, say
    conclusions. This corresponds to the possibility of having one-sided
    formulations of \kl{sequent calculi} for \kl{classical} logic, by restricting negation
    to atomic formulas and extending it to arbitrary formulas through De Morgan
    dualities\sidenote{See for instance the one-sided \kl{sequent calculus} in
    \cite{girard:hal-01322183}.}
  \end{remark}
  
  In their graphical representation, the \kl{bi-intuitionistic} $\mathbb{F}$-rules of
  \kl{system~B} are equivalent to the three following \emph{topological laws},
  that we call the \emph{$\mathbb{F}$-laws}\sidenote{Hopefully, those are not
  \emph{flaws} of our \emph{flow} rules, but rather the opposite\dots}:
  \begin{fact}[$\mathbb{F}$-laws]\labfact{bubbles-flaws}
    \sbr
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \kl{Polarized} \kl{bubbles} trap (resp. repel) \kl{items} with a different (resp.
      identical) \kl{polarity}.
      \item \kl{Neutral} \kl{bubbles} trap (resp. repel) \kl{polarized} (resp. \kl{neutral}) \kl{items}.
      \item \kl{Polarized} \kl{bubbles} both trap and repel \kl{neutral} bubbles.
    \end{enumerate}
  % For any bubble $S$, and any trajectory $\mathfrak{T}$ in space of any item $I$
  % that crosses $S$:
  % \begin{align*}
  %   \text{$\mathfrak{T}$ crosses $S$ inwards if and only if $\pol{I} \not= \pol{S}$.} \\
  %   \text{Conversely, $\mathfrak{T}$ crosses $S$ outwards if and only if $\pol{I} = \pol{S}$.}
  % \end{align*}
  % where we denote the polarity of any item $J$ in a solution by $\pol{J}$.
  \end{fact}
  In \reffig{bubbles-porosity}, the ability of \kl{bubbles} to trap (resp. repel)
  \kl{items} corresponds to outward (resp. inward) orange arrows. $\mathbb{F}$-laws
  are thus the ``negative'' counterpart --- in the grammatical sense --- of
  $\mathbb{F}$-rules, represented by green arrows. The fact that purple arrows
  are demoted to orange arrows in \kl{bi-intuitionistic} logic, can be interpreted as
  resulting from their violation of the first $\mathbb{F}$-law. The second and
  third $\mathbb{F}$-laws characterize the behavior of \kl{neutral} bubbles, and are
  respected by all rules of \kl{system~B}.
  
  In particular, they suggest the addition of a new $\mathbb{F}$-rule
  \kl{f{\ua}}, which allows to move \kl{neutral} \kl{bubbles} out of other \kl{neutral}
  bubbles. When looking at it as a graphical \kl{rewriting rule} in
  \reffig{graphical-B}, it can be seen as the act of \emph{abstracting} the
  \kl{subgoal} $T$ from its parent \kl{subgoal} $S$, since the hypotheses and conclusions
  of $S$ cannot be brought to interact with those of $T$ anymore. More generally
  in \kl{bi-intuitionistic} logic, all flow rules can be understood as
  \emph{abstraction} moves, that strengthen the \kl{goal} by moving irreversibly an
  \kl{item} $I$ out of its \kl{subgoal} $S$. In the case of outward rules (whose name ends
  with $\ua$), $I$ is brought closer to the \emph{root} of the proof tree;
  and in the case of inward rules (whose name ends with $\da$), $I$ is
  brought closer to the \emph{leaves} of the proof tree.
  % More generally, all outwards flow rules (whose name ends with $\ua$) can
  % be understood as \emph{abstraction} moves that strengthen the goal, by moving
  % an item closer to the root of the proof tree; and dually, all inwards flow
  % rules (whose name ends with $\da$) correspond to \emph{concretization}
  % moves that weaken the goal, by moving an item towards the leaves of the proof
  % tree.
  
  It would be interesting to try to formalize $\mathbb{F}$-laws, and more
  generally the graphical presentation of \kl{system~B}, with the rigorous
  tools of mathematical topology. This has been done for instance in
  \sidecite[-18em]{brady_categorical_2000} for the \kl{existential graphs} of C. S.
  Peirce (see \refch{flowers}).

  \item[\textbf{\membrane}] 
  We still have the popping rule \kl{p} of \kl{BJ}, which is now restricted to
  closed empty bubbles. We add two popping rules \kl{p{-}} and \kl{p{+}} for
  popping respectively \kl{negative} and \kl{positive} closed empty bubbles. Like the
  \kl{i{\da}} rule, these have the effect of closing the ambient
  \kl{solutions}, and for the same reasons we thus restrict them to open ambient
  \kl{solutions}.

  \begin{marginfigure}
    \input{figures/bubbles-uustalu}
    \caption{A proof of Uustalu's formula in \kl{system~B}}
    \labfig{bubbles-uustalu}
  \end{marginfigure}

  The novelty compared to \kl{BJ} is that we also add so-called
  \emph{absorption rules} $\{\kl{a},\kl{a{-}},\kl{a{+}}\}$ for membranes.
  These rules state that when a \kl{bubble} contains only a single \kl{neutral} bubble,
  the membrane of the latter can be absorbed into the membrane of the former.
  This is mainly useful when one wants to apply an outward $\mathbb{F}$-rule to
  an \kl{item} that has the same \kl{polarity} as the outer bubble, as witnessed by the
  use of the \kl{a{+}} rule in the proof of Uustalu's formula in
  \reffig{bubbles-uustalu}. This formula was first introduced in
  \sidecite{hutchison_proof_2009} as a counter-example to the \kl{cut-elimination}
  theorem of Rauszer's \kl{sequent calculus} for \kl{bi-intuitionistic} logic
  \sidecite{rauszer_formalization_1974}, and our initial motivation for
  introducing absorption rules was precisely to provide a cut-free proof of this
  formula in \kl{system~B}.

  Later, we realized that there is an interesting \emph{symmetry} at play
  between popping rules and absorption rules. As mentioned in
  \refsec{bubbles-pba}, popping rules can be understood as resulting from a
  process of \emph{contraction} of membranes into a single point. Dually,
  absorption rules can be seen as the result of a process of \emph{expansion} of
  the inner \kl{bubble} towards the outer bubble. While contraction gets stuck on
  \kl{polarized} \kl{items} because they cannot cross \kl{neutral} membranes outwards,
  expansion gets stuck on \kl{neutral} \kl{items} because they cannot cross \kl{neutral}
  membranes inwards. Thus there is a very natural interplay between
  $\mathbb{M}$-rules, and the $\mathbb{F}$-laws induced by $\mathbb{F}$-rules.

  \item[\textbf{\heating}] 
  Like the \kl{i{\ua}} rule, the \kl{\bot{-}}, \kl{\lor{-}} and
  \kl{{\limp}{-}} rules become truly local in \kl{system~B} by letting
  $\mathbb{F}$-rules handle the distribution of conclusions in \kl{subgoals}.
  Together with their dual rules \kl{\top{+}}, \kl{\land{+}} and
  \kl{{\limp}{+}}, they constitute the \emph{closing} $\mathbb{H}$-rules of
  \kl{system~B}. All other $\mathbb{H}$-rules work in arbitrary \kl{solutions} just
  as in \kl{BJ}. But thanks to the ability to have multiple conclusions
  (\refsec{symm-interp}) and \kl{positive} \kl{bubbles} (\refsec{colors}), both the
  \kl{\lor{+}} and \kl{{\limp}{+}} rules are now \emph{\kl{invertible}}: this was
  the initial motivation for designing the symmetric \kl{bubble calculus}.
