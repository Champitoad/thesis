% \section*{Foreword}

This thesis is the result of a long, challenging and deeply personal journey. It has been equally demanding on both my intellectual and emotional resources, pushing their limits to unforeseen heights. But in return it rewarded me with a great wealth of experiences and insights, nourishing my mind and my soul on an unprecedented scale. It would be no exaggeration to state that it turned me into a fully fledged adult, with my PhD defense acting as a coming of age ceremony\footnote{I have my mother to thank for this remarkable analogy.}.

Thus it is only natural that I write the following paragraphs of acknowledgments in the first person, singular: while in the rest of this document my individuality is dissolved into the plural, objective and spatio-temporally spread ``we'' of science, here I want to remind the reader of the situatedness and subjectivity involved in the production of knowledge, of its irreductibly human nature. Knowledge only exists because it is \emph{meaningful} to humans, because humans are meaningful to eachother.

Due to my fleeting memory, I am afraid I can only mention \emph{some} of the people who were instrumental in making my PhD a meaningful endeavor; whether they supported my work, or inspired my life (and \textit{vice versa}); either because they believed in the science, or cared for the person that I am (and the other way around).

\section*{The road behind}

People often say they ``fall in love'' with a given subject: I tend to believe they mean it quite literally. At least this is what happened to me 8 years ago, when I discovered formal logic. I instantly knew that it would occupy much of my thoughts, filling my days with intense questions and reflections, and my nights with feverish dreams full of weird symbols and pictures. But I could never imagine having the opportunity to dedicate myself to this relationship for such an extended time span.

As with many things in life, it is a series of encounters that put me on this peculiar path, the first of which being Mathieu Jaume's logic course in the ``licence d'informatique'' of Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC). The clarity of his teaching instilled precision and rigor in me, two essential qualities for an aspiring logician. I am also grateful to one of his teaching assistant at the time (a PhD student whose name I unfortunately cannot remember), who nurtured my newfound passion for logic through passionate discussions and specially-tailored bonus homeworks. It is also in Mathieu's practical sessions that I discovered \kl{Edukera} (mentioned in \refsec{edukera} and \refsec{flowers-search}), which might have ingrained at a very early stage the idea at the heart of my thesis, that logic is intimately related to (direct) \emph{manipulation}.

The next fateful encounter happened with Pierre Talbot, another teaching assistant at UPMC and PhD student at IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique). I talked to him after a lab session of our Compilation course, because I was interested in his research at the intersection of logic programming and music theory. After mentioning my deep interest in logic, he recommended that I check out this thing called ``linear logic'', and in particular the book ``Le Point Aveugle'' written by Jean-Yves Girard.

Saying that this tremendously impacted my vision of logic would be an understatement. I found in Girard's works a school of thought, an unexpected echo to my own philosophical reflections about language and reality. It provided a revolutionary framework in which I could deconstruct the notion of ``truth'', something that traditional logic only hinted at in incomplete and unsatisfactory ways. It has really guided and shaped much of my studies and research in the following years, helping me to quench my thirst for foundational answers along the way. In particular, it led me to study philosophy for one year at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, writing my memoir on Girard's ludics under the supervision of Alberto Naibo. The year after I got my first research internship at Université Paris Diderot supervised by Alexis Saurin, working again on a ludics-related subject.

\section*{The road itself}

My PhD journey truly started in 2020 with my research internship at École Polytechnique, under the supervision of Benjamin Werner and Pierre-Yves Strub. When I discovered their project of creating better GUIs for proof assistants, I immediately applied. Although it did not involve any linear logic, it was a perfect mix of theoretical and applied research that aligned nicely with one of my broader goals: making programming more correct, interactive, and accessible to non-specialists. After some very encouraging results exploiting Chaudhuri's subformula linking \cite{Chaudhuri2013}, Benjamin and Pierre-Yves proposed that I keep working on the subject of ``Graphical Interfaces for Proofs'' for an entire PhD thesis. I cannot thank them enough for giving me this wonderful opportunity.
